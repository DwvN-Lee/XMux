"""Ensure a project path is listed as trusted in ~/.codex/config.toml.

Codex shows an interactive "Do you trust this directory?" prompt on the
first launch inside an unknown cwd. When codex is spawned via the xmux
bridge, that prompt's `› 1. Yes, continue` option line matches the
bridge's idle pattern `^[[:space:]]*›` and causes a false idle detection.
The bridge then chunks its queued message into the trust prompt, which
codex interprets as invalid input and terminates the pane — producing
the "chunk paste-buffer failed / pane is gone" failure observed in
fe-debug-pipeline.

Pre-populating the projects table with `trust_level = "trusted"` makes
codex skip the trust prompt, so the bridge reaches the real prompt and
its idle detection operates on the normal input line only.

Idempotent: re-trusting an already-trusted path is a no-op.

Usage:
  python3 trust_codex_project.py <path>
